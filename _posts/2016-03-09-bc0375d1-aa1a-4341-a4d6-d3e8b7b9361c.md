Eclipse.

It's supposed to be an event for me to witness the greatness of  Allah, but I was driving in a massive traffic trying to get my son to school as fast as I could, hoping to clock the 'least late' time in. 

So I chase after the time in this world, rather than chasing after full appreciation of God and my religion.

That's the eclipse in me.
